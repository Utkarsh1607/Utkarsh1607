<!--### :heavy_minus_sign: Interested on my Story?
When I graduated as a Biotechnology engineer, I never thought that I would be on the path to become a web developer. When i did my graduation I started my preparation for govt. job but i not success at there.
However, that  prepartion  did not provide me the satisfaction and job  that I was seeking for  Private job where my career growth is increase  fast. This is when I came across the career option of web development and was immediately intrigued.

While I was exploring career paths on web development, I learned about Masai school and joined a 30-weeks full-time course on Full-Stack Web Development. Ever since, I became determined to learn new skills and frameworks. I was able to apply my learnings while developing projects and that became an enjoyable process.

I started from scratch with next to no knowledge about web development. But, in the span on 2 months I was able to build an E-commerce page with proper flow and validations. This experience ignited a spark in me to learn and develop more.

With Masai school, I have developed my skills with hands-on experience on MERN stack, critical thinking by solving Data Structures and Algorithms. Through learning and implementing, I have become an expert in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

My previous work experience, combined with everything that I have learnt in the past few months has enhanced my skills in coordination, clear communication and decision making.

My hobbies include travelling, reading books, exploring movies and listening to music.

Looking forward to applying the acquired skills on solving intricate problems and making life much easier.
